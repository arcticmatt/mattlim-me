          I think everyone has a few of these. These are projects I spent a
          non-trivial amount of time and effort on, but never really saw the
          light of day. This is currently an incomplete list, I&apos;ll add some
          more things here over time.

              Creator Inbox was a tool that connected people with experienced
              creators. Beginners could get targeted, personal feedback, and
              experts could get paid for their expertise. We launched a beta
              version of the product, but it didn't gain traction.

              Folio was a marketplace that connected artists to companies that
              wanted to license art. We got far enough that I built basically
              the whole site with Firebase, realized Firebase has a lot of
              limitations, and then migrated it to GraphQL + Relay. Eventually,
              we stopped working on it because the market size was quite small.

              Wizards was an expert network for game devs. We didn&apos;t get
              very far with this oneâ€”the landing page isn&apos;t even finished.
              I think it looks cool though.
